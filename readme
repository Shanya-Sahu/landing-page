Unzip the files, then go into the folder and start it. I've included a picture of my design in the assets folder.

Please note that the font might not be exactly the same as in the picture because I used a similar one. I hope this is okay!

I estimate it will take about 2 hours to complete. The time might be shorter if you can provide the Figma file.

Best regards,
